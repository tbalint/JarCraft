JarCraft
========

Starcraft combat simulator based on SparCraft project, implemented in JAVA to use with JNIBWAPI

Please read installation guide for JNIBWAPI if you intend to use JarCraft with Starcraft.

JarCraft could be used as a stand alone testing tool, in this case it is not required to have JNIBWAPI installed. To do so you will have to use JNIBWAPI_LOAD.class.
